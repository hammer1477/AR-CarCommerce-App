Hellooo Guys with the ARCarColorChange App!!

Note: When it comes to the script of color change and ARPlacement...

You will find Resources.Load{with the path of the prefabs}

I just removed the example prefabs that I was working on for Storage issues but it works dynamically assigning perfectly

Color Change Script:

Also Resources.Load{with the path to the mats you want to change color}

Removed with the 3D models uploaded with the prefabs for Storage issues.

Sorry for the inconvenience...


Note:Resources Method (ex: Resources.Load) works only when you have a Resources Folder under your assets folder 
so don't forget to "Make" a resources folder that will have a "Prefabs" folder and a "Materials" folder to be able to load them.

Note: Scene is available under ExampleAssets\Scenes where everything is located there .

Thankkksss .. :) I hope this text clarify things ! :>
